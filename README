FRED:

Simple, stripped down JavaScript layered drawing environment with multitouch events, with an eye towards tablet web/vector authoring.

===========================================

For more information, contact jeff@unterbahn.com
There is usually a reasonably recent demo available at http://fred.unterbahn.com

===========================================

To-do:

- text in polygons, text tool to edit text, 
	- doubleclick in select tool to switch to text tool
- styling in CSS-like syntax (like Cartagen)
- Group class which can self-contain and matrix transform
- fix android viewport width/height
	- try removeing Fred.resize() entirely
- auto-detection and connection of on_foo events
	- this partially done
- alias events like on_touchstart > on_mousedown
- color, linewidth, fill style panel, swipe open?
- tool selection for mobile devices
- stop_observing is not working, tools don't deselect properly
- bezier curves with control key, some alternative for multitouch
	- line 73 of pen.js shouldn't be necessary - modifier key not turning off
- shift key locks line drawing to 45 degree angles

- full iPhone/Android multitouch, with editing UI
- this list is getting more ambitious as it goes so I'll finish now

===========================================

To contribute, please fork the project in Github: https://github.com/jywarren/fred, Then send pull requests! 

You'll have to edit the files in <fred root>/src/, then run 'rake build' from the Fred root directory and it'll compile everything in the /src/ directory into /fred.js, stripping out comments as it goes. This helps maintain ordering of the source loading, and also helps with minification.

You can also just create new tools in /tools/, adding them to Fred.tools, just as the pen tool is: Fred.tools.pen

Tools 'take over' mouse events and must have:

- <tool>.select() and <tool>.deselect() methods which are called when the tool is selected with Fred.select_tool('pen')
	- the deselect() method is called when you switch to a different tool, and must unsubscribe the tools listeners
- <tool>.draw() method which is called every frame
- <tool>.description, a string which describes the tool (used in tooltips and menus)
